# Day3-with-java

I am so greatful beacause I am learning new things day by day.

No more wait here is my day3 learning of java.

Today I learned how to write a program if the given number is multiple of 3 then return "Hey I am varam" or if the given number is multiple of 5 then return "I am lakshmi" or if the given number is multiple of both 3and 5, then return "I am varalakshmi ".

Here is the logic for this:

if(n%15 ==0) {

system.out.println("varam");

}

elseif(n%3 == 0) {

system.out.println("lakshmi");

}

elseif(n%5 == 0) {

system.out.println("varalakshmi");

}

Along with this programming I learned about variable. THere are mainly two variables called as instance and local variables. 


Also learned what are  pass by value and pass by reference. And what is the difference between them.
